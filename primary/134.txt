It is to reuse anything that can be used again. Recycling may save our world. \u201c Recycling\u201d also means doing everything we can do to prevent (\u963b\u6b62) the need for recycling. How do we do this? Here are some suggestions:\nIf you bring your own bags with you to the shop, you won\u2019t need to use the bags of the shop. This will save bags before they need to be recycled.\nDon\u2019t buy things that can be used only once(\u4e00\u6b21). For example, use cloth naplins (\u9910\u5dfe) instead of (\u4ee3\u66ff)paper napkins.\nPut on warm clothes in the cold season, dress in cool clothes during the warm seasons and avoid\uff08\u907f\u514d\uff09using air conditions (\u7a7a\u8c03).\nDon\u2019t leave the fridge door open for a long time!\nTurn things off after you use them.
