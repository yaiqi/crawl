It was the biggest one. They put it near a big tree. That was where the snowman would sit.\nSecond, they rolled a ball for the middle. It was medium size, smaller than the first ball. They had to lift it on top of the first one.\nThird, they made the top snowball. It had to be smaller for the head. It was hard for the kids to lift it on top of the other two.\nThe kids had to put on arms. They used two long sticks. The branches looked like fingers. Then they put on the buttons. Three rocks worked for those. They used rocks for the eyes and mouth, too.\nOne boy gave up his scarf for the snowman. A girl gave up her hat. The snowman was nearly finished! The last step was making the nose. They used a big carrot, and the snowman was done finally!", "id": "primary31.txt", "scores": [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]}
